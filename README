       Speech::Speakup         The Speakup screen-reader

Speakup is a screen-reader that runs on Linux as a module within the
kernel.  A screen-reader allows blind or visually-impaired people to
hear text as it appears on the screen, and to review text already
displayed anywhere on the screen. Speakup only runs on linux consoles,
but is powerful and ergonomic, and runs during the boot process.

The Speech::Speakup module allows applications a consistent,
easy-to-use interface to get or set Speakup's various parameters.

Speakup has parameters at the screen-reader level that you can
get and set by using the routines speakup_get and speakup_set.

One of those parameters is the particular voice synthesiser engine
that speakup will use; this synthesiser has its own parameters,
parameters that speakup will use when invoking it, and which you
can get and set by using the routines synth_get and synth_set.

To install just:
   perl Makefile.PL ; make ; make install

A call-interface-compatible Python3-module may be included one day,
but is not yet included.
